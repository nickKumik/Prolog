To apply backward chaining, we start with the hypothesis C and attempt to work backward through the rules 
to determine if there are any conditions that must be met in order for C to be true. Here are the steps 
involved in backward chaining for this scenario:


First we start to look for a rule that directly implies C. Rule 1 is the only rule that has C in its conclusion. Now
we can use this rule to determine what conditions must be met for C to be true. Rule 1 states that if A and B are true.
Then C must be true. Meaning we need to determine that A and B are true in order for C to be true. Rule 2 is the only rule which
has a A as its conclusion. Which states that if X is not tue then A must be true. Meaning we need to determine that X is not true
in order for A to be true. Rule 3 is the only rule which has a X as its conclusion. Which states that if D and F are true then X must be true. 
How ever since their is no rule which directly implies B we cannot determine whether B is true. Since we cannot determine whether B is true
we cannot determine whether C is true either. Therefore we cannot infer that hypothesis C can be inferred based on the given knowledge base
and starting conditions.
